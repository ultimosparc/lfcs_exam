Essential Commands domain might appears more frequently then others. For this domain you will have to:

    Archive, backup, compress and uncompress files using tar (along with gz/bz/xz)
    Searching files (using find, a lot of it in different levels)
    Compare and manipulate file content (using diff for example)
    Input-output redirection (>,>>,<<,<,|,2&1 etc.)
    Create, manage hard and soft links
    List, set, and change standard file permissions (including SUID/SGID, sticky bit)
    Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories
    Using all other common console utilities
    Read and use system documentation (man, apropos commands are your friends during exam)
